# CNC Work Offsets

In CNC machining, "G coordinate systems" (often called Work Offsets) act like user-definable bookmarks that tell the machine where your specific part is located within its workspace.

The machine has one absolute reality (Machine Coordinates), but you can create multiple temporary "zero points" (Work Coordinates) to match where you bolted down your material.

## 1. The Hierarchy of Coordinate Systems

It helps to visualize these as layers, starting from the machine's hardware and moving up to your specific part.

| Coordinate System       | G-Code            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Machine Coordinates** | **G53**           | The absolute "truth." `(0,0,0)` is typically the home switch location. These values never change unless you physically move a switch. `G53` is non-modal (applies only to the current line) and is often used for tool changes or safe parking [[millrightcnc](https://millrightcnc.com/2018/07/gcodeintro/)]​. |
| **Work Offsets**        | **G54 - G59**     | The most common user systems. You jog the machine to the corner of your stock, zero it, and that location becomes `(0,0,0)` for `G54`. If you have multiple vices, you might use `G55` for the second vice [mhcc.pressbooks+1](https://mhcc.pressbooks.pub/supportcnc/chapter/g54-g59-an-introduction/).        |
| **Extended Offsets**    | **G59.1 - G59.3** | Additional offsets if you need more than the standard six (G54-G59). FluidNC and LinuxCNC support these for complex fixtures [[linuxcnc](https://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/gcode/coordinates.html)]​.                                                                                                              |

## 2. Common Coordinate G-Codes

- **G54 (Default Work Offset):** This is the standard "user mode." When you turn on most hobby CNCs or restart FluidNC, it usually defaults to G54. When you click "Zero X" in your control software, you are updating the G54 register to say "Current Machine Position = Work Position 0".[[millrightcnc](https://millrightcnc.com/2018/07/gcodeintro/)]​

- **G92 (Temporary/Local Offset):** This is a "temporary" shift often used for manual operations. It resets the coordinates *without* changing the stored G54 data. **Warning:** G92 is a common source of crashes because it persists until canceled (often with `G92.1`). If you abort a job with a G92 active and restart, your machine might think it's in a completely different place.[[linuxcnc](https://linuxcnc.org/docs/html/gcode/coordinates.html)]​

- **G10 (Programmable Offset):** This allows you to set coordinate values *inside* the G-code program itself, rather than manually jogging and zeroing. For example, `G10 L2 P1 X10 Y10` explicitly tells the machine "Set the G54 X-zero to be 10mm from the Home switch".[[gcodetutor](https://gcodetutor.com/cnc-machine-training/cnc-g-codes.html)]​

## 3. Absolute vs. Incremental Positioning

While not strictly "coordinate systems," these modes determine how the machine interprets the numbers you give it within the active coordinate system.

- **G90 (Absolute):** "Go to coordinate X=10." If the tool is at X=5, it moves +5. If it is at X=15, it moves -5. This is the standard for almost all CAM software.[norck+1](https://www.norck.com/blogs/news/cnc-g-code-list-commands-and-programming-functions)

- **G91 (Incremental):** "Move +10 from where you are now." If the tool is at X=5, it moves to X=15. If it is at X=15, it moves to X=25. This is rarely used in main programs but is standard for subroutines or manual jogging commands.[[gcodetutor](https://gcodetutor.com/cnc-machine-training/cnc-g-codes.html)]​

## Summary for Your Workflow

Since you use FluidNC:

1. **Homing:** Always home the machine first to establish **G53**.

2. **Job Setup:** Jog to your workpiece corner and "Zero" the axes. This sets **G54**.

3. **The Code:** Your G-code file (generated by LightBurn or Fusion 360) will almost exclusively use **G54** (implicitly) and **G90** (Absolute moves).

4. **Avoid G92:** Unless you have a specific reason, avoid using G92 in your generated code; rely on G54-G59 work offsets instead to keep your "Zero" consistent even after power cycling.
